## Reproducibility:
Our group's report is Report.html, which is fully reproducible by knitting Report.RMD. Knitting the RMD requires the R package "rmdformats". It should knit without any issue. However, if any error occurred, which I doubt would happen, please contact qigu9636@uni.sydney.edu.au. Thanks!

## Important Note:
This assignment's instructions were contradictory and unclear, and we were not able to receive anything helpful from Ed. We initially considered creating a PDF report which was much more academic. However, we eventually chose to submit a RMD with embedded code for discreet reasons, which seemed to be a safer decision.
